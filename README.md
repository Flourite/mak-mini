## The App
[Download latest releases](https://github.com/inns/mak-mini/releases).

### “Maximally Minimal”

The simplicity of plain text, the power of Markdown. 

Besides taking notes, you can **interact** with your document to organize it. Checkboxes and links are clickable, drop files to open, code editor shortcuts... Which all make it so intuitive to use in your way. Todo-list, story outlines or linked fragments, it's up to you.

For links start with a hashtag (#), it's just a **file** in Mak. You can either use Markdown links (`[](#notes)`) or select "List" in the tray menu to jump to that file.

There're powerful **commands**, of course. By typing `go:`, you can quick jump to any files or create a new one. And by typing `set:`, you can do customizations or run advanced commands, like **print / generate PDF** and **export data**.

Most importantly, each advanced feature does not break the experience of any basic functionalities. If you don't need some feature, it doesn't exist.

For more details & usage, please read [Mak: a piece of paper](https://github.com/inns/mak).  
If you have any suggestions or feedbacks, feel free to open a issue.

### macOS

Mak<sup>mini</sup> is a menubar App, just as simple as [Mak](https://mak.ink). But unlike the browser version, Mak<sup>mini</sup> is **NOT** designed to be focused on. The key point is **easy to access**.

You can use it just like stickers, todo list, quick notes, temporary clipboard with read-it-later URLs, or **any mess you don't know where to put**.

It's not a focus writing tool. The reading and split mode are both disabled currently.

### TouchBar Support (MacBook 2016)

TouchBar is convenient and intuitive. That's also parts of Mak's philosophy, and Mak<sup>mini</sup> works perfectly with it.

### Windows

There's also a Windows version. The dark theme looks gorgeous in Windows 10.
